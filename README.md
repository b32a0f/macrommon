# macrommon
Inactive Window Automation Functions with Python and Win32 API.

Developed for game macro using Android emulator.
Tested on LDPlayer.

I HATE AHK.
  
# How to use
  1. Install pywin32 package. (Don't use conda command. pip will save you. or use VS env.)
  2. Learn about Window handle and spy++.
  3. Import module and Make macro script as you think fit.

# Note
  - Sure target Client Window Size before write script.
  - It does not guarantee a definite movement. (But pretty working well.)
  - It will not be appropriate for program has many handles.
